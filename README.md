# OtterBet
OtterBet is a sportsbetting simulation app for users to place wagers on real Vegas lines set by real sportsbooks on real NFL games, but without spending real money.

## Setup

## Features

## Technologies
OtterBet was built with the following technologies:
 - Node.js
 - React
 - React-Router-DOM
 - React Redux
 - Axios
 - Express
 - PostgreSQL
 - Material UI

Data was collected from the following API sources:
 - [odds-api](https://the-odds-api.com/)
 - [API-Sports](https://api-sports.io/)

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project was to create a functional full-stack React app with a dynamic user experience utilizing data from third-party API. 

## Duration
This project was primarily developed over a two-week sprint in September 2023. Minor refactoring has continued since then, but major refactoring and feature additions will be reserved for committed future sprints.

## Future Goals
Impending updates to OtterBet will likely center on more general concerns:
 - Refactor code to limit technical debt
 - Develop personalized user profiles
 - Improve styling

However, there are also several major features
 - Refresh game data through automated API requests at set intervals
 - Implementation of additional leagues beyond the NFL
 - Implementation of public contests for users to compete with one another
 - Make additional game data available to users, such as team and player statistics
 - Add sorting and filtering options on user and market bets for improved user experience

A more detailed list of refactoring and feature aspirations can be found on this [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/H5o8f8Su/otterbet).
